Marketing website for the IfElse Network

## Status
This is currently just a temporary page so that visitors don't get linked to an empty page. We should eventually replace this with a proper marketing website.

### Colors
We need another branding colour, because white and purple are associated with text because of our logo. I tried experimenting with a new one for the links, but it doesn't look too great. Can someone please try and find a better option?
